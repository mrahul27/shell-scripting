how to capture output of a command if its success or error/failure and store the result?

example:if ls comamnd

ls 1>out.txt 2>error.txt

here 

STD codes:
0--stdin standard input
1-- stdout standard output which will be displayed in terminal
2--stderr standard error 
so if execute a cmd lsd 1>out.txt 2>error.txt  since there is no cmd called lsd , it will throw error and capture the error to error.txt

Another way to store output(both valid o/p or error ,anything):

using wrong cmd for illustration,like:

instead of ls ,use dsls
dsls 1>out.txt 2>&1

it means if valid output is fetched, that is 1, then store the value to out.txt
If its not a valid o/p, instead an error, store the error in same file as out.txt

so , dsls 1>out.xt 2>&1  --& is a pointer to 1, where 1 is pointing to out.txt  

both in single file.
