Conditional statement:
==  used to decide if a condition is true or not

ex:
if [expression==true]
then
      echo statemnt 1
      echo statement 2

fi

here if the expression is true, then only lines(codes) between then and fi will be executed.

How to create exrepssions:
FOr numbers:
     x=5
     y=10
     now to compare, these 2 numbers, we can use  RELATIONAL operators:
     -eq ---equal to
     -ne --- not equal to
     -gt  ---greater than
     -lt -- less than
     -ge== greater than or equal to
     -le== less than or equal to

For strings:

x=active
y=inactive

we need to use 
==
!=
-n --non zero
-z ---zero

Best practice while assgining value to a variable , put it in double quotes. since string needs to be put inside double quotes

ex x=10 is correct , but practice using x="10"
but for string x=date is wrong, it should be x="date" so better practice ""
