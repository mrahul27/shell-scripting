How to make a Linux shell script to run as normal linux command?

1. Create a shell script with execute permission
2. Create your own bin directory for ease of use. since all executable files will be under /bin directory
3. for ex:
 vi sample.sh
 #!/bin/bash
 uptime
 uname -r
 java -version
 :wq!
 chmod +x sample.sh
 echo $PATH
 
 Put the sample.sh under a directory like /myscripts/bin/ and add the path to system PATH variable
 PATH=$PATH:/myscripts/bin

 now instead of executing it as ./sample.sh, Just enter the command as sample.sh and hit enter
