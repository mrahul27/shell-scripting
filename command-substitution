Command substituition:

ie if we want to store or assign output of any linux command to a variable instead of a file.

ie instead of uptime >> upt.txt

i need to assign the out put to variable

so ,
  upt=`uptime`  -- here its single inverted comma ..NOT single quotes
  now do a echo cmd to give output of variable upt

  echo -e "${upt}"  this will give output of upt variable.

  or we can use this method

  mydate=$(date)
  echo "${mydate}"  this cmd also can be used to store output of cmd to a variable instead of file


  Next is exit command usage:

  #!/bin/bash
  echo "This is first line of the script"
  exit
  echo " This is the last line of the script"
  :wq!
  here , when we execute the script. only 1st echo cmd will get executed. since exit is given , code after exit will be ignored by shell script and it will exit out the bash shell

real time use case;
check service status , if service is running then dont start the service again

once exit cmd is executed
do echo $?
o -- this means exit completed successfully

but if you give
exit 2

echo$?
2-- value 2 is prointed.. change the exit status code of shell script.

We can get output of a command in 3 ways inside a shell script like below.
[mrahul27@localhost ~]$ cat date.sh
#!/bin/bash
date

echo "`date`"

mydate=`date`
echo "${mydate}"

:wq!
